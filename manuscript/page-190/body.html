He may have loved me at first sight, but the impression he gave me was that he didn't think a lot of me and wasn't betting much that I would improve a great deal on acquaintance.

Oh, Wooster, don't you know, and what not."</p><p>"My pop's richer than you are!"</p><p>That seemed to be all about me. The child having said his say, started in on the jam again. I turned to Jeeves.</p><p>"I say, Jeeves, can you spare a moment? I want to show you something."</p><p>"Very good, sir." We toddled into the sitting-room.</p></div> </div>
