The boy is of an outspoken disposition, and had made an opprobrious remark respecting my personal appearance."</p><p>"What did he say about your appearance?"</p><p>"I have forgotten, sir," said Jeeves, with a touch of austerity.

And yet—if he's such a sprinter, why hasn't anybody in the village found it out? Surely he plays with the other boys?"</p><p>"No, sir. As his lordship's page-boy, Harold does not mix with the village lads."</p><p>"Bit of a snob, what?"</p><p>"He is somewhat acutely alive to the existence of class distinctions, sir."</p></div> </div>
