<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The drive that afternoon was about as mouldy as I had expected. The curate chappie prattled on of this and that; the girl admired the view; and I got a headache early in the proceedings which started at the soles of my feet and got worse all the way up. I tottered back to my room to dress for dinner, feeling like a toad under the harrow. If it hadn't been for that cummerbund business earlier in the day I could have sobbed on Jeeves's neck and poured out all my troubles to him. Even as it was, I couldn't keep the thing entirely to myself.</p><p>"I say, Jeeves," I said.</p><p>"Sir?"</p><p>"Mix me a stiffish brandy and soda."</p><p>"Yes, sir."</p><p>"Stiffish, Jeeves. Not too much soda, but splash the brandy about a bit."</p><p>"Very good, sir."</p><p>After imbibing, I felt a shade better.</p></div> </div>
