<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">into the Park to do pastoral dances."</p><p>I don't know if you know that sort of feeling you get on these days round about the end of April and the beginning of May, when the sky's a light blue, with cotton-wool clouds, and there's a bit of a breeze blowing from the west? Kind of uplifted feeling. Romantic, if you know what I mean. I'm not much of a ladies' man, but on this particular morning it seemed to me that what I really  wanted was some charming girl to buzz up and ask me to save her from assassins or something. So that it was a bit of an anti-climax when I merely ran into young Bingo Little, looking perfectly foul in a crimson satin tie decorated with horseshoes.</p><p>"Hallo, Bertie," said Bingo.</p><p>"My God, man!" I gargled. "The cravat! The gent's neckwear! Why? For what reason?"</p><p>"Oh, the tie?" He blushed. "I—er—I was given it."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">He seemed embarrassed, so I dropped the subject.</p></div> </div>
