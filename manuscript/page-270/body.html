He's down here during the summer holidays, acting as locum tenens for Mr. Spettigue, the rector of Gandle-by-the-Hill."</p><p>"I thought I knew his face.

"There's the old egg."</p><p>"There's who?"</p><p>"Young Bingo Little. Great pal of mine. He's tutoring your brother, you know."</p><p>"Good gracious! Is he a friend of yours?"</p><p>"Rather! Known him all my life."</p><p>"Then tell me, Bertie, is he at all weak in the head?"</p><p>"Weak in the head?"</p><p>"I don't mean simply because he's a friend of yours. But he's so strange in his manner."</p></div> </div>
