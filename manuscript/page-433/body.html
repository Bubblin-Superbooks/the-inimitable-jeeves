And the long and the short of it is, Bertie, old man, I'm leaving to-morrow."</p><p>I reeled in my tracks.</p><p>"You are?" I gasped.</p><p>"Yes. If," said Claude, "you won't mind sending old Jeeves out to buy a ticket for me. I'm afraid I'll have to stick you for the passage money, old man. You don't mind?"</p><p>"Mind!" I said, clutching his hand fervently.</p><p>"That's all right, then. Oh, I say, you won't say a word to Eustace about this, will you?"</p><p>"But isn't he going, too?"</p><p>Claude shuddered.</p><p>"No, thank heaven! The idea of being cooped up on board a ship with that blighter gives me the pip just to think of it. No, not a word to  Eustace. I say, I suppose you can get me a berth all right at such short notice?"</p></div> </div>
