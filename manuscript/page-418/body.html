Twenty minutes earlier and she would have found the twins gaily shoving themselves outside a couple of rashers and an egg. She sank into a chair, and I could see that she was not in her usual sunny spirits.</p><p>"Bertie," she said, "I am uneasy."</p><p>So was I. I didn't know how long she intended to stop, or when the twins were coming back.</p><p>"I wonder," she said, "if I took too harsh a view towards Claude and Eustace."</p><p>"You couldn't."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"I—er—mean it would be so unlike you to be harsh to anybody, Aunt Agatha." And not bad, either. I mean, quick—like that—without thinking. It pleased the old relative, and she looked at me with slightly less loathing than she usually does.</p></div> </div>
