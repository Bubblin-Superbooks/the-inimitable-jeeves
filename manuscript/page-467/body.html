<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This was the passage:</p><blockquote><p><em>"What can prevail"—Millicent's eyes flashed as she faced the stern old man—"what can prevail against a pure and all-consuming love? Neither principalities nor powers, my lord, nor all the puny prohibitions of guardians and parents. I love your son, Lord Mindermere, and nothing can keep us apart. Since time first began this love of ours was fated, and who are you to pit yourself against the decrees of Fate?"</em>
<em>The earl looked at her keenly from beneath his bushy eyebrows.</em>
<em>"Humph!" he said.</em></p></blockquote><p>Before I had time to refresh my memory as to what Millicent's come-back had been to that remark, the door opened and old Bittlesham rolled in. All over me, as usual.</p><p>"My dear Mr. Wooster, this is an unexpected pleasure. Pray take a seat. What can I do for you?"</p><p>"Well, the fact is, I'm more or less in the capacity of a jolly old ambassador at the moment. Representing young Bingo, you know."</p></div> </div>
