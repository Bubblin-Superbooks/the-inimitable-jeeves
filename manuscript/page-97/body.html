<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">people's birthdays, and letters to post, and all thatâ€”but not an absolute bally insult like the above. I brooded like the dickens.</p><p>I was still brooding when I dropped in at the oyster-bar at Buck's for a quick bracer. I needed a bracer rather particularly at the moment, because I was on my way to lunch with Aunt Agatha. A pretty frightful ordeal, believe me or believe me not, even though I took it that after what had happened at Roville she would be in a fairly subdued and amiable mood. I had just had one quick and another rather slower, and was feeling about as cheerio as was possible under the circs, when a muffled voice hailed me from the north-east, and, turning round, I saw young Bingo Little propped  up in a corner, wrapping himself round a sizable chunk of bread and cheese.</p><p>"Hallo-allo-allo!" I said. "Haven't seen you for ages. You've not been in here lately, have you?"</p></div> </div>
