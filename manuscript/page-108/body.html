If the latter was surprised and delighted too, he concealed it like a diplomat. He just looked at me, raised his eyebrows slightly, and went on fishing. He was one of those supercilious striplings who give you the impression that you went to the wrong school and that your clothes don't fit.</p><p>"This is Oswald," said Bingo.</p><p>"What," I replied cordially, "could be sweeter? How are you?"</p><p>"Oh, all right," said the kid.</p><p>"Nice place, this."</p><p>"Oh, all right," said the kid.</p><p>"Having a good time fishing?"</p><p>"Oh, all right," said the kid.</p><p>Young Bingo led me off to commune apart.</p><p>"Doesn't jolly old Oswald's incessant flow of prattle make your head ache sometimes?" I asked.</p></div> </div>
