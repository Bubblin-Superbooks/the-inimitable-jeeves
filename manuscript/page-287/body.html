<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">afternoon, when, as I was strolling up and down in front of the house with a cigarette, Claude and Eustace came bursting up the drive on bicycles, dripping with momentous news.</p><p>"Bertie," said Claude, deeply agitated, "unless we take immediate action and do a bit of quick thinking, we're in the cart."</p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p>"G. Hayward's the matter," said Eustace morosely. "The Lower Bingley starter."</p><p>"We never even considered him," said Claude. "Somehow or other, he got overlooked. It's  always the way. Steggles overlooked him. We all overlooked him. But Eustace and I happened by the merest fluke to be riding through Lower Bingley this morning, and there was a wedding on at the church, and it suddenly struck us that it wouldn't be a bad move to get a line on G. Hayward's form, in case he might be a dark horse."</p></div> </div>
