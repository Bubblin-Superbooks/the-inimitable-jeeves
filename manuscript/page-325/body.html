<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">evening service on Sunday, the day before the sports.</p><p>"Why on earth?" I said, never being much of a lad for evensong.</p><p>"Well, I can't go myself. I shan't be here. I've got to go to London to-day with young Egbert." Egbert was Lord Wickhammersley's son, the one Bingo was tutoring. "He's going for a visit down in Kent, and I've got to see him off at Charing Cross. It's an infernal nuisance. I shan't be back till Monday afternoon. In fact, I shall miss most of the sports, I expect. Everything, therefore, depends on you, Bertie."</p><p>"But why should either of us go to evening service?"</p><p>"Ass! Harold sings in the choir, doesn't he?"</p><p>"What about it? I can't stop him dislocating his neck over a high note, if that's what you're afraid of."</p><p>"Fool! Steggles sings in the choir, too. There may be dirty work after the service."</p><p>"What absolute rot!"</p></div> </div>
