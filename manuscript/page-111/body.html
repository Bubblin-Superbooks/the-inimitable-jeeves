I mean you wanting to make a hit with Honoria Glossop and all that. Why, take it from me, laddie, he would have shoved you behind that clump of bushes over there; he would have got me to lure Honoria on to the bridge somehow; then, at the proper time, he would have told me to give the kid a pretty hefty jab in the small of the back, so as to shoot him into the water; and then you would have dived in and hauled him out. How about it?"</p><p>"You didn't think that out by yourself, Bertie?" said young Bingo, in a hushed sort of voice.</p><p>"Yes, I did. Jeeves isn't the only fellow with ideas."</p><p>"But it's absolutely wonderful."</p><p>"Just a suggestion."</p></div> </div>
