Good name in man or woman, dear my lord," he said, massaging the fin with some fervour, "is the immediate jewel of their souls. Who steals my purse steals trash. 'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands. But he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which enriches not him and makes me poor indeed.

"Rather a sad affair, Jeeves," I said.</p><p>"Yes, sir."</p><p>"Lucky I happened to have all that money handy."</p><p>"Well—er—yes, sir."</p><p>"You speak as though you didn't think much of it."</p><p>"It is not my place to criticise your actions, sir, but I will venture to say that I think you behaved a little rashly."</p></div> </div>
